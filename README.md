# Employee Polls

## App Overview

This a polls app that allows employees create their own polls and vote to other polls created by others. Every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. The app has a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. An employee can ask a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible. Users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
